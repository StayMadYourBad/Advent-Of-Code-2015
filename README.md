# The Grinch's Revenge


## Introduction

Santa, big old fat and lazy Santa, decided to reach out to Advent of Code to help him solve his challenges he comes across when delivering gifts (and coal) to all the children of the world. I - the famous and most powerful Grinch - need Santa to solve these challenges and have a super ultra smooth Christmas. When he is busy solving and getting through our trap's and ambushes, he would not notice the gifts in his bag, slowly and "magically" disappearing one by one.


## The Problem

My little helpers have lost the answer key and I NEED it in order to execute the plan efficiently. We will be taking the same route Santa does, hence needing the solution so we wont waste any time solving them at all! But it does seem like we will need too, so I used this very mysterious platform called "Github" to store it. Some place where low iq Santa will never even think to look for. Everything, and I mean everything must go according to plan.

As the wise man once said, "Would you be at peace with the world and be at war with yourself, or have peace with yourself and be at war with the world"
